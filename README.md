### Link to Deployed Website
If you used the stencil code, this is `https://superpig666.github.io/development`

### Goal and Value of the Application
This is a bakery app where I used images and content from React Studio and users can find the pastries they want and add them to the cart by using the category selector and sorting method.

### Usability Principles Considered
I used a responsive layout, which ensures that as the screen grows larger, each pastry card does not become too large for the user to use.

### Organization of Components
The overall layout is divided into `Header`, `Content` and `Sider`, which are laid out through the `Layout` function of ant design react.

### How Data is Passed Down Through Components
Via props and pass the parameters into Components when calling.

### How the User Triggers State Changes
With react's `useState` feature, the State is refreshed every time the user performs an action.
